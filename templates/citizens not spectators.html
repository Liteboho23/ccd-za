    <h1>Citizens in Action: Informed Citizens, Better Choices.</h1>
    <p>Empowering youth through voter education.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <p><strong>Programme Focus:</strong> To increase voter participation and civic engagement across all demographics by providing accessible, accurate, and engaging education on election procedures, voter rights, and the importance of active participation in democracy.</p>

    <p>The "Citizens, Not Spectators" initiative aims to increase voter turnout across all groups by providing clear and accessible information on election procedures, key dates, voter rights, and how to vote correctly. Its goal is to build confidence, demystify the electoral process, and encourage active civic participation among youth, first-time voters, and marginalized communities.</p>

    <p>The programme includes Election Readiness Information Sessions, which offer detailed briefings on election processes, and Election Readiness Workshops for hands-on training on voting. Election Pop-Up Events are held at accessible community locations to directly engage and inform voters.</p>

    <p>To promote understanding and dialogue, the initiative hosts Democracy Dialogues focused on democratic rights and responsibilities. It also runs Digital & Social Media Campaigns to reach a wider audience with educational content and voter encouragement. These combined efforts aim to create an informed, active electorate and strengthen trust in the electoral system.</p>
