    <h1>Electoral Integrity and Observation Programme</h1>
    <p>Ensuring credible elections through observation.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <p><strong>Programme Focus:</strong> To promote electoral integrity, transparency, and democratic accountability.</p>

    <p>The Electoral Integrity and Observation Programme is a key initiative designed to promote electoral integrity and democratic accountability. The programme deploys trained observers to monitor electoral processes objectively, ensuring compliance with national legislation, international standards, and best practices.</p>

    <p>The primary objective of the programme is to provide independent, factual assessments of election procedures and outcomes. These assessments help identify strengths and weaknesses within the electoral system, deter misconduct, and promote transparency. The programme’s reports serve as authoritative references for electoral authorities, political stakeholders, civil society, and the public, fostering trust and confidence in the electoral process.</p>

    <p>By ensuring elections are conducted freely, fairly, and transparently, the Electoral Integrity and Observation Programme supports the broader goal of strengthening democratic governance, protecting civil and political rights, and promoting inclusive participation. It is an essential component of CCD’s efforts to uphold democratic principles and enhance the integrity of electoral processes.</p>
