    <p><strong>Programme Focus:</strong> Civic Engagement, Constitution Education, and Citizen Participation</p>

    <p>"Democracy in Action" is a comprehensive civic education programme designed to empower South Africans to understand and actively participate in their democracy. The programme educates citizens on how government functions at all levels, with a focus on local governance, and encourages direct engagement through community workshops, town hall forums, school programmes, and tours of government offices. It promotes voter participation and active involvement in civic life.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the programme emphasizes the practical importance of the Constitution in everyday life. It aims to deepen understanding of constitutional rights, responsibilities, and how these principles shape society. Through media campaigns, civic education activities, and community outreach, it makes constitutional knowledge relatable and accessible for all. The programme seeks to create an informed, responsible, and engaged citizenry capable of shaping South Africaâ€™s democratic future through active participation and constitutional awareness.</p>
